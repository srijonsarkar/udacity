# Exploring Weather Trends - Project Instructions

## Summary

In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you 
live to overall global temperature trends.

## Instructions
Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences 
between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. Since I live in 
Kolkata, India I chose to work with the city Patna.
