# STUDY STROOP EFFECT

## Description

In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop 
Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the 
task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have 
performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret 
your results in terms of your hypotheses.
