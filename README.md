# udacity-data-analyst-nanodegree
The contents of this folder are the assignments/projects that I had to submit to my reviewers as part of the
Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.

Completed both terms in July 2018.

All projects except the first 2 contain a Jupyter notebook or an RMD file which contains entire analysis. And
the last project is a Tableau project, hence results can be seen on my public tableau
